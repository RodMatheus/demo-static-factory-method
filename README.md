# demo-static-factory-method

The objective of this project was to test the use of static factory methods in entity classes, as well as their integration with Spring Data JPA and Mapstruct.

To run the project, just define a development .properties file, or just use and fill in the example file (application-example.properties).

It will also be necessary to create the tables and their appropriate data insertions, the database chosen for the example was PostgreSQL. To modify this decision, change the application.properties file and driverClassName from the application-example.properties file.
